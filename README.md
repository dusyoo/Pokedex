This website was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I used Visual Studio code and PokeAPI.

# Pokedex

Pokedex using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for constructing RESTful API.
<br>
PokeAPI provides a RESTful API interface to highly detailed objects built from thousands of lines of data related to Pokémon.
<br>
Also used [Pokemon-API](https://purukitto.github.io/pokemon-api/) for pixelated sprites.
